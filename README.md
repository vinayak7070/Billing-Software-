Billling Software for Restro using C language
This C code enables the user to generate and store restaurant invoices.
The menu-driven program offers choices for generating bills, seeing all saved bills, and searching for a particular bill. The customer name, date, and information about the ordered items are stored in the code using structures. 
The user is prompted by the programme to enter information about the customer, the number of things requested, and item specifics like name, quantity, and unit pricing.
The overall cost of the order is then calculated, a 10% discount is applied, the CGST and SGST are calculated, and the final bill with all the data is displayed. 
The program retains the bill in a file called "bill" if the user wants to save it.
